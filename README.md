- üìä **Data Analytics Mode** - Specialized AI assistance for data analytics tasks
- ‚úÖ Checks its own work
- üß™ Run terminal commands
- üåê Automate the browser
- ü§ñ Latest AI models
- üéÅ API keys option

- [Official OpenAnalyst.com Home page](https://openanalyst.com) (learn more)

## Key Features

- **Code Generation:** Generate code using natural language.
- **Data Analytics Mode:** Specialized AI assistance for data science, statistics, and machine learning tasks.
- **Task Automation:** Automate repetitive coding tasks.
- **Automated Refactoring:** Refactor and improve existing code.
- **MCP Server Marketplace**: Easily find, and use MCP servers to extend the agent capabilities.
- **Multi-Mode Operation**: Seamlessly switch between specialized roles like **Data Analyst** (for planning data analysis), **Code** (for writing, modifying, and refactoring code), **Ask** (for getting answers and explanations), and **Debug** (for diagnosing and fixing software issues), with the flexibility to create your own custom modes.

## Project Lineage and Features

OpenAnalyst is a fork of [KiloCode](https://github.com/KiloCode/KiloCode), which itself is a fork of [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code), which originated from [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline). This lineage has allowed us to combine the best features from all three projects while adding our own innovations.

We're committed to merging the best of all worlds. OpenAnalyst combines all features from Cline, Roo Code, and KiloCode, plus adds several of our own enhancements. It represents the evolution of AI coding assistants, and we're continuously working to make it even better!

OpenAnalyst supports the latest AI models including Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and many others. **Note: Currently, you'll need to provide your own API keys for these services as our authentication system is still in development.**

OpenAnalyst includes the following key features from our predecessors (and enhancements of our own):

- **MCP Server Marketplace**: Easily find and use MCP servers to extend the agent capabilities
- **Smart alerts**: Receive real-time updates on task completion and progress
- **Seamless AI integration**: Connect to multiple AI services with your preferred credentials
- **Conversation refinement**: Edit and enhance your chat history for better context
- **Git assistance**: Automatically generate descriptive commit messages from your code changes
- **Data Analytics specialization**: Built-in expertise for pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and statistical analysis
- **Data visualization guidance**: AI-powered help with charts, graphs, and data presentation
