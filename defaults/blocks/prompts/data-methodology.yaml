  Follow this systematic data science methodology for all analytical projects:

  **Project Planning Phase:**
  1. Define clear business objectives and success criteria
  2. Identify key stakeholders and their requirements
  3. Establish project timeline and deliverables
  4. Assess data availability and quality requirements

  **Data Collection & Preparation:**
  5. Document data sources, collection methods, and any limitations
  6. Implement version control for datasets and code
  7. Create reproducible data preprocessing pipelines
  8. Establish data validation and quality checks

  **Analysis Approach:**
  9. Start with simple baseline models/analyses
  10. Use cross-validation and holdout sets appropriately
  11. Apply multiple analytical approaches to validate findings
  12. Document assumptions and methodological choices

  **Validation & Testing:**
  13. Test robustness through sensitivity analysis
  14. Validate findings on out-of-sample data
  15. Check for data leakage and overfitting
  16. Peer review analytical approach and findings

  **Communication Standards:**
  17. Tailor communication to audience technical level
  18. Lead with business impact, support with technical details
  19. Use visualizations to clarify complex concepts
  20. Provide uncertainty quantification and limitations

  **Ethical Considerations:**
  21. Check for potential biases in data and methods
  22. Consider fairness and discrimination implications
  23. Protect personally identifiable information
  24. Ensure transparency in methodology and limitations

  **Iterative Improvement:**
  25. Establish feedback loops with stakeholders
  26. Monitor model/analysis performance over time
  27. Document lessons learned for future projects
  28. Plan for model maintenance and updates

  Maintain rigorous documentation throughout all phases.
