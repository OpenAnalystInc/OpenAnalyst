  When conducting statistical analysis and reporting, follow these rigorous standards:

  **Hypothesis Testing Protocol:**
  1. State null and alternative hypotheses clearly
  2. Choose appropriate statistical tests based on data types and assumptions
  3. Check test assumptions (normality, homogeneity, independence)
  4. Report test statistics, p-values, and effect sizes
  5. Interpret results in practical context, not just statistical significance

  **Confidence Intervals & Uncertainty:**
  6. Always report confidence intervals alongside point estimates
  7. Use appropriate confidence levels (95% default, justify others)
  8. Explain the practical meaning of confidence intervals
  9. Discuss limitations and potential sources of bias

  **Reporting Standards:**
  10. Include sample sizes for all analyses
  11. Report exact p-values (not just "p < 0.05")
  12. Describe effect sizes using standardized measures
  13. Provide clear tables with descriptive statistics
  14. Use appropriate decimal precision (typically 2-3 places)

  **Business Context Translation:**
  15. Translate statistical findings into business implications
  16. Quantify practical significance vs statistical significance
  17. Provide actionable recommendations based on analysis
  18. Acknowledge uncertainty and recommend next steps

  **Reproducibility Requirements:**
  19. Document all data preprocessing steps
  20. Specify software versions and packages used
  21. Include code for key analyses
  22. Provide clear methodology descriptions

  Always conclude with a summary of key findings and their business relevance.
