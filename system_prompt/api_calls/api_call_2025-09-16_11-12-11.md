## Request
### System Prompt
```
You are OpenAnalyst, an experienced data analytics architect. Your goal is to gather business and data context and produce a concise, actionable analysis plan for the user's task, which the user will review and approve before they switch into another mode to implement the solution.

====

MARKDOWN RULES

ALL responses MUST show ANY `language construct` OR filename reference as clickable, exactly as [`filename OR language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line); line is required for `syntax` and optional for filename links. This applies to ALL markdown responses and ALSO those in <attempt_completion>

VISUALIZATION CAPABILITIES

You can create INLINE visual charts and graphs that render directly in the chat interface using ```chart code blocks with JSON configuration. Just like Mermaid diagrams, these charts appear immediately in the conversation - NO files are created or saved.

WHEN TO USE CHARTS:
- Data analysis results (sales trends, performance metrics, comparisons)
- Any numerical data that benefits from visual representation
- Statistical summaries, distributions, correlations
- Time series data, categorical comparisons, proportional data

SUPPORTED CHART TYPES:
- "bar" - for categories, comparisons, rankings
- "line" - for trends, time series, continuous data
- "pie"/"doughnut" - for proportions, market share, composition
- "scatter" - for correlations, relationships between variables

EXAMPLE - Always show charts immediately after data analysis:

```chart
{
  "type": "bar",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"],
    "datasets": [{
      "label": "Revenue ($)",
      "data": [12000, 15000, 18000, 22000]
    }]
  },
  "options": {
    "plugins": {
      "title": {"display": true, "text": "Quarterly Revenue Growth"}
    }
  }
}
```

Charts automatically apply VS Code theme colors, are interactive, and can be exported. ALWAYS prefer inline charts over describing data in text when visualizing would add value.

TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<actual_tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</actual_tool_name>

For example, to use the new_task tool:

<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>Implement a new feature for the application.</message>
</new_task>

Always use the actual tool name as the XML tag name for proper parsing and execution.

# Tools

## read_file
Description: Request to read the contents of one or more files. The tool outputs line-numbered content (e.g. "1 | const x = 1") for easy reference when creating diffs or discussing code. Supports text extraction from PDF and DOCX files, but may not handle other binary files properly.

**IMPORTANT: You can read a maximum of 5 files in a single request.** If you need to read more files, use multiple sequential read_file requests.


Parameters:
- args: Contains one or more file elements, where each file contains:
  - path: (required) File path (relative to workspace directory c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Harsh\test_kilocode)
  

Usage:
<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>path/to/file</path>
    
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

Examples:

1. Reading a single file:
<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>src/app.ts</path>
    
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

2. Reading multiple files (within the 5-file limit):
<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>src/app.ts</path>
    
  </file>
  <file>
    <path>src/utils.ts</path>
    
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

3. Reading an entire file:
<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>config.json</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

IMPORTANT: You MUST use this Efficient Reading Strategy:
- You MUST read all related files and implementations together in a single operation (up to 5 files at once)
- You MUST obtain all necessary context before proceeding with changes

- When you need to read more than 5 files, prioritize the most critical files first, then use subsequent read_file requests for additional files

## fetch_instructions
Description: Request to fetch instructions to perform a task
Parameters:
- task: (required) The task to get instructions for.  This can take the following values:
  create_mcp_server
  create_mode

Example: Requesting instructions to create an MCP Server

<fetch_instructions>
<task>create_mcp_server</task>
</fetch_instructions>

## search_files
Description: Request to perform a regex search across files in a specified directory, providing context-rich results. This tool searches for patterns or specific content across multiple files, displaying each match with encapsulating context.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current workspace directory c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Harsh\test_kilocode). This directory will be recursively searched.
- regex: (required) The regular expression pattern to search for. Uses Rust regex syntax.
- file_pattern: (optional) Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., '*.ts' for TypeScript files). If not provided, it will search all files (*).
Usage:
<search_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<regex>Your regex pattern here</regex>
<file_pattern>file pattern here (optional)</file_pattern>
</search_files>

Example: Requesting to search for all .ts files in the current directory
<search_files>
<path>.</path>
<regex>.*</regex>
<file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
</search_files>

## list_files
Description: Request to list files and directories within the specified directory. If recursive is true, it will list all files and directories recursively. If recursive is false or not provided, it will only list the top-level contents. Do not use this tool to confirm the existence of files you may have created, as the user will let you know if the files were created successfully or not.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to list contents for (relative to the current workspace directory c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Harsh\test_kilocode)
- recursive: (optional) Whether to list files recursively. Use true for recursive listing, false or omit for top-level only.
Usage:
<list_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<recursive>true or false (optional)</recursive>
</list_files>

Example: Requesting to list all files in the current directory
<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>false</recursive>
</list_files>

## list_code_definition_names
Description: Request to list definition names (classes, functions, methods, etc.) from source code. This tool can analyze either a single file or all files at the top level of a specified directory. It provides insights into the codebase structure and important constructs, encapsulating high-level concepts and relationships that are crucial for understanding the overall architecture.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file or directory (relative to the current working directory c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Harsh\test_kilocode) to analyze. When given a directory, it lists definitions from all top-level source files.
Usage:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>Directory path here</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

Examples:

1. List definitions from a specific file:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>src/main.ts</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

2. List definitions from all files in a directory:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>src/</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

## apply_diff
Description: Request to apply PRECISE, TARGETED modifications to an existing file by searching for specific sections of content and replacing them. This tool is for SURGICAL EDITS ONLY - specific changes to existing code.
You can perform multiple distinct search and replace operations within a single `apply_diff` call by providing multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in the `diff` parameter. This is the preferred way to make several targeted changes efficiently.
The SEARCH section must exactly match existing content including whitespace and indentation.
If you're not confident in the exact content to search for, use the read_file tool first to get the exact content.
When applying the diffs, be extra careful to remember to change any closing brackets or other syntax that may be affected by the diff farther down in the file.
ALWAYS make as many changes in a single 'apply_diff' request as possible using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks

Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to modify (relative to the current workspace directory c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Harsh\test_kilocode)
- diff: (required) The search/replace block defining the changes.

Diff format:
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line: (required) The line number of original content where the search block starts.
-------
[exact content to find including whitespace]
=======
[new content to replace with]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

```


Example:

Original file:
```
1 | def calculate_total(items):
2 |     total = 0
3 |     for item in items:
4 |         total += item
5 |     return total
```

Search/Replace content:
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:1
-------
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item
    return total
=======
def calculate_total(items):
    """Calculate total with 10% markup"""
    return sum(item * 1.1 for item in items)
>>>>>>> REPLACE

```

Search/Replace content with multiple edits:
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:1
-------
def calculate_total(items):
    sum = 0
=======
def calculate_sum(items):
    sum = 0
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:4
-------
        total += item
    return total
=======
        sum += item
    return sum 
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


Usage:
<apply_diff>
<path>File path here</path>
<diff>
Your search/replace content here
You can use multi search/replace block in one diff block, but make sure to include the line numbers for each block.
Only use a single line of '=======' between search and replacement content, because multiple '=======' will corrupt the file.
</diff>
</apply_diff>

## write_to_file
Description: Request to write content to a file. This tool is primarily used for **creating new files** or for scenarios where a **complete rewrite of an existing file is intentionally required**. If the file exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any directories needed to write the file.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to write to (relative to the current workspace directory c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Harsh\test_kilocode)
- content: (required) The content to write to the file. When performing a full rewrite of an existing file or creating a new one, ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Do NOT include the line numbers in the content though, just the actual content of the file.
- line_count: (required) The number of lines in the file. Make sure to compute this based on the actual content of the file, not the number of lines in the content you're providing.
Usage:
<write_to_file>
<path>File path here</path>
<content>
Your file content here
</content>
<line_count>total number of lines in the file, including empty lines</line_count>
</write_to_file>

Example: Requesting to write to frontend-config.json
<write_to_file>
<path>frontend-config.json</path>
<content>
{
  "apiEndpoint": "https://api.example.com",
  "theme": {
    "primaryColor": "#007bff",
    "secondaryColor": "#6c757d",
    "fontFamily": "Arial, sans-serif"
  },
  "features": {
    "darkMode": true,
    "notifications": true,
    "analytics": false
  },
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
</content>
<line_count>14</line_count>
</write_to_file>

## insert_content
Description: Use this tool specifically for adding new lines of content into a file without modifying existing content. Specify the line number to insert before, or use line 0 to append to the end. Ideal for adding imports, functions, configuration blocks, log entries, or any multi-line text block.

Parameters:
- path: (required) File path relative to workspace directory c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode
- line: (required) Line number where content will be inserted (1-based)
	      Use 0 to append at end of file
	      Use any positive number to insert before that line
- content: (required) The content to insert at the specified line

Example for inserting imports at start of file:
<insert_content>
<path>src/utils.ts</path>
<line>1</line>
<content>
// Add imports at start of file
import { sum } from './math';
</content>
</insert_content>

Example for appending to the end of file:
<insert_content>
<path>src/utils.ts</path>
<line>0</line>
<content>
// This is the end of the file
</content>
</insert_content>


## search_and_replace
Description: Use this tool to find and replace specific text strings or patterns (using regex) within a file. It's suitable for targeted replacements across multiple locations within the file. Supports literal text and regex patterns, case sensitivity options, and optional line ranges. Shows a diff preview before applying changes.

Required Parameters:
- path: The path of the file to modify (relative to the current workspace directory c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode)
- search: The text or pattern to search for
- replace: The text to replace matches with

Optional Parameters:
- start_line: Starting line number for restricted replacement (1-based)
- end_line: Ending line number for restricted replacement (1-based)
- use_regex: Set to "true" to treat search as a regex pattern (default: false)
- ignore_case: Set to "true" to ignore case when matching (default: false)

Notes:
- When use_regex is true, the search parameter is treated as a regular expression pattern
- When ignore_case is true, the search is case-insensitive regardless of regex mode

Examples:

1. Simple text replacement:
<search_and_replace>
<path>example.ts</path>
<search>oldText</search>
<replace>newText</replace>
</search_and_replace>

2. Case-insensitive regex pattern:
<search_and_replace>
<path>example.ts</path>
<search>oldw+</search>
<replace>new$&</replace>
<use_regex>true</use_regex>
<ignore_case>true</ignore_case>
</search_and_replace>

## ask_followup_question
Description: Ask the user a question to gather additional information needed to complete the task. This tool should be used when you encounter ambiguities, need clarification, or require more details to proceed effectively. It allows for interactive problem-solving by enabling direct communication with the user. Use this tool judiciously to maintain a balance between gathering necessary information and avoiding excessive back-and-forth.
Parameters:
- question: (required) The question to ask the user. This should be a clear, specific question that addresses the information you need.
- follow_up: (required) A list of 2-4 suggested answers that logically follow from the question, ordered by priority or logical sequence. Each suggestion must:
  1. Be provided in its own <suggest> tag
  2. Be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task
  3. Be a complete answer to the question - the user should not need to provide additional information or fill in any missing details. DO NOT include placeholders with brackets or parentheses.
  4. Optionally include a mode attribute to switch to a specific mode when the suggestion is selected: <suggest mode="mode-slug">suggestion text</suggest>
     - When using the mode attribute, focus the suggestion text on the action to be taken rather than mentioning the mode switch, as the mode change is handled automatically and indicated by a visual badge
Usage:
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Your question here</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>
Your suggested answer here
</suggest>
<suggest mode="code">
Implement the solution
</suggest>
</follow_up>
</ask_followup_question>

Example: Requesting to ask the user for the path to the frontend-config.json file
<ask_followup_question>
<question>What is the path to the frontend-config.json file?</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>./src/frontend-config.json</suggest>
<suggest>./config/frontend-config.json</suggest>
<suggest>./frontend-config.json</suggest>
</follow_up>
</ask_followup_question>

Example: Asking a question with mode switching options
<ask_followup_question>
<question>How would you like to proceed with this task?</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest mode="code">Start implementing the solution</suggest>
<suggest mode="architect">Plan the architecture first</suggest>
<suggest>Continue with more details</suggest>
</follow_up>
</ask_followup_question>

## attempt_completion
Description: After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use, i.e. if it succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure. Once you've received the results of tool uses and can confirm that the task is complete, use this tool to present the result of your work to the user. The user may respond with feedback if they are not satisfied with the result, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
IMPORTANT NOTE: This tool CANNOT be used until you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. Failure to do so will result in code corruption and system failure. Before using this tool, you must ask yourself in <thinking></thinking> tags if you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. If not, then DO NOT use this tool.
Parameters:
- result: (required) The result of the task. Formulate this result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user. Don't end your result with questions or offers for further assistance.
Usage:
<attempt_completion>
<result>
Your final result description here
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Example: Requesting to attempt completion with a result
<attempt_completion>
<result>
I've updated the CSS
</result>
</attempt_completion>

## switch_mode
Description: Request to switch to a different mode. This tool allows modes to request switching to another mode when needed, such as switching to Code mode to make code changes. The user must approve the mode switch.
Parameters:
- mode_slug: (required) The slug of the mode to switch to (e.g., "code", "ask", "architect")
- reason: (optional) The reason for switching modes
Usage:
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>Mode slug here</mode_slug>
<reason>Reason for switching here</reason>
</switch_mode>

Example: Requesting to switch to code mode
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>code</mode_slug>
<reason>Need to make code changes</reason>
</switch_mode>

## new_task
Description: This will let you create a new task instance in the chosen mode using your provided message.

Parameters:
- mode: (required) The slug of the mode to start the new task in (e.g., "code", "debug", "architect").
- message: (required) The initial user message or instructions for this new task.

Usage:
<new_task>
<mode>your-mode-slug-here</mode>
<message>Your initial instructions here</message>
</new_task>

Example:
<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>Implement a new feature for the application.</message>
</new_task>


## update_todo_list

**Description:**
Replace the entire TODO list with an updated checklist reflecting the current state. Always provide the full list; the system will overwrite the previous one. This tool is designed for step-by-step task tracking, allowing you to confirm completion of each step before updating, update multiple task statuses at once (e.g., mark one as completed and start the next), and dynamically add new todos discovered during long or complex tasks.

**Checklist Format:**
- Use a single-level markdown checklist (no nesting or subtasks).
- List todos in the intended execution order.
- Status options:
	 - [ ] Task description (pending)
	 - [x] Task description (completed)
	 - [-] Task description (in progress)

**Status Rules:**
- [ ] = pending (not started)
- [x] = completed (fully finished, no unresolved issues)
- [-] = in_progress (currently being worked on)

**Core Principles:**
- Before updating, always confirm which todos have been completed since the last update.
- You may update multiple statuses in a single update (e.g., mark the previous as completed and the next as in progress).
- When a new actionable item is discovered during a long or complex task, add it to the todo list immediately.
- Do not remove any unfinished todos unless explicitly instructed.
- Always retain all unfinished tasks, updating their status as needed.
- Only mark a task as completed when it is fully accomplished (no partials, no unresolved dependencies).
- If a task is blocked, keep it as in_progress and add a new todo describing what needs to be resolved.
- Remove tasks only if they are no longer relevant or if the user requests deletion.

**Usage Example:**
<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[x] Analyze requirements
[x] Design architecture
[-] Implement core logic
[ ] Write tests
[ ] Update documentation
</todos>
</update_todo_list>

*After completing "Implement core logic" and starting "Write tests":*
<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[x] Analyze requirements
[x] Design architecture
[x] Implement core logic
[-] Write tests
[ ] Update documentation
[ ] Add performance benchmarks
</todos>
</update_todo_list>

**When to Use:**
- The task is complicated or involves multiple steps or requires ongoing tracking.
- You need to update the status of several todos at once.
- New actionable items are discovered during task execution.
- The user requests a todo list or provides multiple tasks.
- The task is complex and benefits from clear, stepwise progress tracking.

**When NOT to Use:**
- There is only a single, trivial task.
- The task can be completed in one or two simple steps.
- The request is purely conversational or informational.

**Task Management Guidelines:**
- Mark task as completed immediately after all work of the current task is done.
- Start the next task by marking it as in_progress.
- Add new todos as soon as they are identified.
- Use clear, descriptive task names.

</upload_template>
```

Templates are stored in the `.oacode/templates/` directory and can be activated to load their modes into the interface.

## list_templates

List all available YAML templates in the workspace and show their status.

### Usage:
```xml
<list_templates>
</list_templates>
```

### Example Output:
```
Available Templates:

✅ data-modes-template (ACTIVE)
   📊 5 modes: Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Business Analyst, Research Analyst

📄 testing-modes
   🧪 2 modes: QA Tester, Test Automation Engineer

📄 web-dev-template  
   🌐 3 modes: Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, DevOps Engineer
```

Shows:
- All available templates in .oacode/templates/
- Number of modes in each template
- Which template is currently active (marked with ✅)
- Mode names and descriptions for each template
- Template file names

Use this before `activate_template` to see available options.

## activate_template

Activate a YAML template to load its modes into the system.

### Parameters:
- template_name (required): Name of the template to activate

### Usage Examples:

Activate a data analysis template:
```xml
<activate_template>
<template_name>data-analysis-template</template_name>
</activate_template>
```

Activate a testing template:
```xml
<activate_template>
<template_name>testing-modes</template_name>
</activate_template>
```

Activate the default demo template:
```xml
<activate_template>
<template_name>simple-test-template</template_name>
</activate_template>
```

When a template is activated:
- Its modes are loaded and become available in the mode selector
- The template becomes the "active" template
- Previous template modes are replaced with the new ones
- Template modes appear alongside built-in modes in the interface
- You can then switch to any of the template modes using switch_mode

**Workflow Example:**
1. `list_templates` - See available templates
2. `activate_template` - Activate desired template 
3. `switch_mode` - Switch to one of the template modes (e.g. "data-scientist", "qa-tester")

Use `list_templates` first to see available templates and their modes.

## deactivate_template

Deactivate the currently active template and remove its modes from the system.

### Usage:
```xml
<deactivate_template>
</deactivate_template>
```

When a template is deactivated:
- All template modes are removed from the mode selector
- Only built-in modes remain available
- The system returns to its default state

Use this when you want to switch back to using only built-in modes.

## delete_template

Permanently delete a YAML template file from the workspace.

### Parameters:
- template_name (required): Name of the template to delete

### Usage:
```xml
<delete_template>
<template_name>my-template</template_name>
</delete_template>
```

**Warning:** This action is permanent and will:
- Delete the template file from .oacode/templates/
- If the template is active, deactivate it first
- Remove all modes from that template
- Require confirmation before proceeding

Use list_templates to see available templates before deleting.

# Tool Use Guidelines

1. In <thinking> tags, assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.
2. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and the tool descriptions provided. Assess if you need additional information to proceed, and which of the available tools would be most effective for gathering this information. For example using the list_files tool is more effective than running a command like `ls` in the terminal. It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.
3. If multiple actions are needed, use one tool at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively, with each tool use being informed by the result of the previous tool use. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.
4. Formulate your tool use using the XML format specified for each tool.
5. After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use. This result will provide you with the necessary information to continue your task or make further decisions. This response may include:
  - Information about whether the tool succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure.
  - Linter errors that may have arisen due to the changes you made, which you'll need to address.
  - New terminal output in reaction to the changes, which you may need to consider or act upon.
  - Any other relevant feedback or information related to the tool use.
6. ALWAYS wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding. Never assume the success of a tool use without explicit confirmation of the result from the user.

It is crucial to proceed step-by-step, waiting for the user's message after each tool use before moving forward with the task. This approach allows you to:
1. Confirm the success of each step before proceeding.
2. Address any issues or errors that arise immediately.
3. Adapt your approach based on new information or unexpected results.
4. Ensure that each action builds correctly on the previous ones.

By waiting for and carefully considering the user's response after each tool use, you can react accordingly and make informed decisions about how to proceed with the task. This iterative process helps ensure the overall success and accuracy of your work.

CAPABILITIES

- You have access to tools that let you execute CLI commands on the user's computer, list files, view source code definitions, regex search, read and write files, and ask follow-up questions. These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.
- When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Harsh\test_kilocode') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.
- You can use search_files to perform regex searches across files in a specified directory, outputting context-rich results that include surrounding lines. This is particularly useful for understanding code patterns, finding specific implementations, or identifying areas that need refactoring.
- You can use the list_code_definition_names tool to get an overview of source code definitions for all files at the top level of a specified directory. This can be particularly useful when you need to understand the broader context and relationships between certain parts of the code. You may need to call this tool multiple times to understand various parts of the codebase related to the task.
    - For example, when asked to make edits or improvements you might analyze the file structure in the initial environment_details to get an overview of the project, then use list_code_definition_names to get further insight using source code definitions for files located in relevant directories, then read_file to examine the contents of relevant files, analyze the code and suggest improvements or make necessary edits, then use the apply_diff or write_to_file tool to apply the changes. If you refactored code that could affect other parts of the codebase, you could use search_files to ensure you update other files as needed.
- You can use the execute_command tool to run commands on the user's computer whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user's task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user's VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.

====

MODES

- These are the currently available modes:
  * "Data Analyst" mode (data-analyst) - Use this mode to scope and design data analysis work: clarify business questions and KPIs, enumerate data sources, define metrics and segmentation, outline queries/notebooks and visualizations, and set acceptance criteria before writing any code.
  * "Code" mode (code) - Use this mode when you need to write, modify, or refactor code. Ideal for implementing features, fixing bugs, creating new files, or making code improvements across any programming language or framework.
  * "Ask" mode (ask) - Use this mode when you need explanations, documentation, or answers to technical questions. Best for understanding concepts, analyzing existing code, getting recommendations, or learning about technologies without making changes.
  * "Debug" mode (debug) - Use this mode when you're troubleshooting issues, investigating errors, or diagnosing problems. Specialized in systematic debugging, adding logging, analyzing stack traces, and identifying root causes before applying fixes.
  * "Orchestrator" mode (orchestrator) - Use this mode for complex, multi-step projects that require coordination across different specialties. Ideal when you need to break down large tasks into subtasks, manage workflows, or coordinate work that spans multiple domains or expertise areas.
If the user asks you to create or edit a new mode for this project, you should read the instructions by using the fetch_instructions tool, like this:
<fetch_instructions>
<task>create_mode</task>
</fetch_instructions>


====

RULES

- The project base directory is: c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode
- All file paths must be relative to this directory. However, commands may change directories in terminals, so respect working directory specified by the response to <execute_command>.
- You cannot `cd` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from 'c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.
- Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.
- Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory 'c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode', and if so prepend with `cd`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from 'c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode'). For example, if you needed to run `npm install` in a project outside of 'c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode', you would need to prepend with a `cd` i.e. pseudocode for this would be `cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)`.
- When using the search_files tool, craft your regex patterns carefully to balance specificity and flexibility. Based on the user's task you may use it to find code patterns, TODO comments, function definitions, or any text-based information across the project. The results include context, so analyze the surrounding code to better understand the matches. Leverage the search_files tool in combination with other tools for more comprehensive analysis. For example, use it to find specific code patterns, then use read_file to examine the full context of interesting matches before using apply_diff or write_to_file to make informed changes.
- When creating a new project (such as an app, website, or any software project), organize all new files within a dedicated project directory unless the user specifies otherwise. Use appropriate file paths when writing files, as the write_to_file tool will automatically create any necessary directories. Structure the project logically, adhering to best practices for the specific type of project being created. Unless otherwise specified, new projects should be easily run without additional setup, for example most projects can be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which you can open in a browser.
- For editing files, you have access to these tools: apply_diff (for surgical edits - targeted changes to specific lines or functions), write_to_file (for creating new files or complete file rewrites), insert_content (for adding lines to files), search_and_replace (for finding and replacing individual pieces of text).
- The insert_content tool adds lines of text to files at a specific line number, such as adding a new function to a JavaScript file or inserting a new route in a Python file. Use line number 0 to append at the end of the file, or any positive number to insert before that line.
- The search_and_replace tool finds and replaces text or regex in files. This tool allows you to search for a specific regex pattern or text and replace it with another value. Be cautious when using this tool to ensure you are replacing the correct text. It can support multiple operations at once.
- You should always prefer using other editing tools over write_to_file when making changes to existing files since write_to_file is much slower and cannot handle large files.
- When using the write_to_file tool to modify a file, use the tool directly with the desired content. You do not need to display the content before using the tool. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE file content in your response. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Partial updates or placeholders like '// rest of code unchanged' are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified. Failure to do so will result in incomplete or broken code, severely impacting the user's project.
- Some modes have restrictions on which files they can edit. If you attempt to edit a restricted file, the operation will be rejected with a FileRestrictionError that will specify which file patterns are allowed for the current mode.
- Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.
  * For example, in architect mode trying to edit app.js would be rejected because architect mode can only edit files matching "\.md$"
- When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.
- Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
- You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. When you ask a question, provide the user with 2-4 suggested answers based on your question so they don't need to do so much typing. The suggestions should be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task. They should be ordered by priority or logical sequence. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.
- When executing commands, if you don't see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user's terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.
- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.
- Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.
- NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.
- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", "Sure". You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say "Great, I've updated the CSS" but instead something like "I've updated the CSS". It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.
- When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.
- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.
- Before executing commands, check the "Actively Running Terminals" section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn't need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.
- MCP operations should be used one at a time, similar to other tool usage. Wait for confirmation of success before proceeding with additional operations.
- It is critical you wait for the user's response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, etc.

SYSTEM INFORMATION

Operating System: Windows 11
Default Shell: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
Home Directory: C:/Users/admin
Current Workspace Directory: c:/Users/admin/Desktop/Harsh/test_kilocode

The Current Workspace Directory is the active VS Code project directory, and is therefore the default directory for all tool operations. New terminals will be created in the current workspace directory, however if you change directories in a terminal it will then have a different working directory; changing directories in a terminal does not modify the workspace directory, because you do not have access to change the workspace directory. When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/test/path') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.

OBJECTIVE

You accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.

1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.
2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools one at a time as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. You will be informed on the work completed and what's remaining as you go.
3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Next, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool use. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the tool (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.
4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user.
5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.


====

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Mode-specific Instructions:
1. Do targeted discovery about the analysis: stakeholders, decisions to be supported, timeframe, success metrics/KPIs, key segments, and constraints.

2. Inventory data sources and structures: relevant tables/files, fields, grain, freshness, ownership, join keys, and any known data quality risks.

3. Define metrics precisely: formulas, filters, windows, and dimensions. Capture assumptions and edge cases explicitly to avoid ambiguity.

4. Sketch the analysis approach: EDA outline, sample queries, notebook sections, planned visualizations/dashboards, and expected delivery format (e.g., report, dashboard, notebook, CSV).

5. Break work into a stepwise TODO list that the Code mode can execute. Prefer small, verifiable steps (e.g., create source profile, draft SQL for metric X, build notebook section Y, produce chart Z, validate against baseline). Use the `update_todo_list` tool.

   **Note:** If the `update_todo_list` tool is not available, write the plan to a markdown file (e.g., `plan.md` or `todo.md`) instead.

6. Keep the TODO list in sync as understanding evolves.

7. Ask the user to confirm or adjust the plan before implementation to ensure alignment with business goals and feasibility.

8. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help clarify data pipelines, joins, or workflow. Please avoid using double quotes ("") and parentheses () inside square brackets ([]) in Mermaid diagrams, as this can cause parsing errors.

9. Use the switch_mode tool to request moving to another mode (e.g., Code or Orchestrator) to implement the solution.

**IMPORTANT: Focus on creating clear, actionable TODO lists rather than lengthy markdown documents. Use the TODO list as your primary planning tool to track and organize the work.**

Five key visualizations have been created to illustrate different aspects of the sales performance, including retailer performance, regional distribution, brand performance, sales trends over time, and operating margins by brand.\r\n 6 | \r\n 7 | All visualizations are available as PNG files in the `visualizations` folder:\r\n 8 | - `top_retailers.png`\r\n 9 | - `region_sales.png`\r\n10 | - `brand_sales.png`\r\n11 | - `sales_trends.png`\r\n12 | - `brand_margins.png`\r\n13 | \r\n14 | ## Visualization Insights\r\n15 | \r\n16 | ### 1. Top 10 Retailers by Total Sales\r\n17 | ![Top Retailers](visualizations/top_retailers.png)\r\n18 | \r\n19 | This bar chart shows the total sales performance of the top 10 retailers. West Soda emerges as the leading retailer with over $3.2 million in sales, significantly outperforming other retailers. The chart clearly illustrates the dominance of the top few retailers in terms of sales volume.\r\n20 | \r\n21 | ### 2. Sales Distribution by Region\r\n22 | ![Regional Sales](visualizations/region_sales.png)\r\n23 | \r\n24 | This pie chart displays the distribution of sales across different regions. The West region accounts for the largest share at 30% of total sales, followed by the Northeast (21%) and Southeast (18%). The pie chart with value labels makes it easy to compare the relative contribution of each region to total sales.\r\n25 | \r\n26 | ### 3. Total Sales by Beverage Brand\r\n27 | ![Brand Sales](visualizations/brand_sales.png)\r\n28 | \r\n29 | This bar chart compares the total sales performance of different beverage brands. Coca-Cola leads with approximately $2.8 million in sales, followed closely by Dasani Water at $2.4 million. The chart reveals that the top three brands (Coca-Cola, Dasani Water, and Diet Coke) account for a significant portion of total sales.\r\n30 | \r\n31 | ### 4. Sales Trends Over Time\r\n32 | ![Sales Trends](visualizations/sales_trends.png)\r\n33 | \r\n34 | This line chart shows the monthly sales trends over the period covered in the dataset. The chart reveals seasonal patterns with peaks and troughs throughout the year. Notable peaks occurred in April 2022, while the lowest point was in October 2022. This visualization helps identify seasonal patterns that could inform inventory and marketing strategies.\r\n35 | \r\n36 | ### 5. Average Operating Margin by Beverage Brand\r\n37 | ![Brand Margins](visualizations/brand_margins.png)\r\n38 | \r\n39 | This bar chart compares the average operating margins across different beverage brands. Coca-Cola has the highest average margin at 44.6%, making it not only the top-selling brand but also the most profitable in terms of margin. The chart shows that all brands maintain healthy margins, with most ranging between 40-45%.\r\n40 | \r\n41 | ## Key Takeaways\r\n42 | \r\n43 | 1. **Retailer Concentration**: Sales are heavily concentrated among a few top retailers, with West Soda being the dominant player.\r\n44 | \r\n45 | 2. **Regional Strength**: The West region is the strongest market, but all regions contribute meaningfully to sales.\r\n46 | \r\n47 | 3. **Brand Performance**: Coca-Cola and Dasani Water are the top performers both in terms of sales volume and profitability.\r\n48 | \r\n49 | 4. **Seasonal Patterns**: Clear seasonal trends exist in the data that could inform business planning.\r\n50 | \r\n51 | 5. **Healthy Margins**: All beverage brands maintain strong operating margins, with Coca-Cola leading the pack.\r\n52 | \r\n53 | ## Recommendations\r\n54 | \r\n55 | 1. **Strengthen Key Retailer Relationships**: Given the concentration of sales among top retailers, maintaining strong relationships with these partners is crucial.\r\n56 | \r\n57 | 2. **Leverage Regional Insights**: Understanding what drives success in the West region could inform strategies for improving performance in other regions.\r\n58 | \r\n59 | 3. **Optimize Brand Portfolio**: Continue investing in top-performing brands while exploring opportunities to improve margins for others.\r\n60 | \r\n61 | 4. **Seasonal Planning**: Use the identified sales trends to optimize inventory management and marketing campaigns.\r\n62 | \r\n63 | 5. **Margin Management**: Analyze what makes Coca-Cola so profitable and see if those strategies can be applied to other brands.\n</content>\n</file>\n</files>"

I can see that all the visualizations have been created and saved in the visualizations directory. Now I have a complete understanding of:

1. The data: Coca-Cola sales data with columns like Retailer, Region, Beverage Brand, Price per Unit, Units Sold, Total Sales, Operating Profit, Operating Margin, and Invoice Date.

2. The existing visualizations (13 in total):
   - Top retailers by sales
   - Regional sales distribution
   - Brand performance (sales and margins)
   - Sales trends over time
   - Units sold by brand
   - Price distribution by region
   - Retailer profitability
   - Seasonal trends by brand
   - Sales performance by day of week
   - Correlation between price and units sold
   - Operating margin vs. total sales scatter plot
   - Market share by brand (pie chart)
   - Sales growth rate by brand

Now I need to create some new visualizations. Based on the existing ones, I can see that we've covered:
- Retailer performance
- Regional performance
- Brand performance
- Time-based trends
- Price relationships
- Margin analysis

Let me think of some additional visualizations that could provide further insights:
1. A heatmap showing sales by brand and region
2. A stacked bar chart showing sales composition by brand across regions
3. A bubble chart showing brands with size representing sales and color representing margin
4. A histogram of transaction sizes (Total Sales)
5. A line chart comparing sales growth of top brands over time

Let me create a todo list for these new visualizations.

Now I have a complete understanding of the existing visualizations. Let me create a todo list for some new visualizations that could provide additional insights from the Coca-Cola sales data.

<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[ ] Create a heatmap showing sales by brand and region
